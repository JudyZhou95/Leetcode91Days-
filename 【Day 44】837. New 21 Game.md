# 837. New 21 Game

https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/


Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.

Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.

 

**Example 1:**\
Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10\
Output: 1.00000\
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.

**Example 2:**\
Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10\
Output: 0.60000\
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.\
In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.

**Example 3:**\

Input: n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10\
Output: 0.73278

**Constraints:**\
0 <= k <= n <= 10^4
1 <= maxPts <= 10^4


## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def new21Game(self, n: int, k: int, maxPts: int) -> float:
        if k == 0 or k + maxPts <= n:
            return 1
        
        dp = [1] + [0] * n
        window_sum = 1 
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            dp[i] = window_sum/maxPts
            if i < k: window_sum += dp[i]
            if i - maxPts >= 0: window_sum -= dp[i-maxPts]
                
        return sum(dp[k:])
```

## Analysis
dp[i] is the probability that we can get i at some moment during this game. dp[i] = sum_all_the_m(dp[i-m] x p(we get an m next draw)). All the possible m values are from 1 to the maxPts, and the probability od getting each one is 1/maxPts. Therefore dp[i] = (1/maxPts) * sum(last maxPts terms of dp). we can maintain a sliding window with size at most maxPts to keep track of the sum in the equation. 
```
 Here let W = maxPts
 When the game ends, the point is between K and K-1+W
    What is the probability that the the point is less than N?
    - If N is greater than K-1+W, probability is 1
    - If N is less than K, probability is 0
    
    If W == 3 and we want to find the probability to get a 5
    - You can get a card with value 1, 2, or 3 with equal probability (1/3)
    - If you had a 4 and you get a 1: prob(4) * (1/3)
    - If you had a 3 and you get a 2: prob(3) * (1/3)
    - If you had a 2 and you get a 3: prob(2) * (1/3)
    - If you had a 1, you can never reach a 5 in the next draw
    - prob(5) = prob(4) / 3 + prob(3) / 3 + prob(2) /3
    
    To generalize:
    The probability to get point K is
    p(K) = p(K-1) / W + p(K-2) / W + p(K-3) / W + ... p(K-W) / W
    
    let wsum = p(K-1) + p(K-2) + ... + p(K-W)
    p(K) = wsum / W
```

**Time Complexity:** O(N)\
**Space Complexity:** O(N)
