# 695. Max Area of Island

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:        
        visited = set()
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == 1 and (i, j) not in visited:

                    tmp = self.dfs(grid, i, j, visited)
                    res = max(res, tmp)
                    
        return res
                    
    def isValid(self, grid, i, j, visited):
        if 0<=i<len(grid) and 0<=j<len(grid[0]) and (i, j) not in visited and grid[i][j]==1:
            return True
        else:
            return False
    
    def dfs(self, grid, i, j, visited):        
        visited.add((i, j))
        area = 1
        for ii, jj in [(i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]:
            if self.isValid(grid, ii, jj, visited):
                area += self.dfs(grid, ii, jj, visited)
                
        return area
                
```
## Analysis
Typical DFS. Iterate through the grid. Find an entrance of island if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited this point. Use a helper function, recursively caculate the area of current island. Similar to Tree problem (caculate the path), the area of the entire island is equal to 1 (current point) + the subisland area(with the entrance of current point neighbors).
