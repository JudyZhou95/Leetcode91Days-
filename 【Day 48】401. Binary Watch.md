# 401. Binary Watch

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-watch/

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def readBinaryWatch(self, turnedOn: int) -> List[str]:
        return [str(a)+":"+ "0"*(b < 10) + str(b) for a in range(12) for b in range(60) if (bin(a) + bin(b)).count('1') == turnedOn]
```

## Analysis
One way is to list all the possible hour, min combination and filter out the ones which meet the requirements. (The total number of ones in the binary expression of hour and min should be equal to the target.)\
Python bin() function returns the binary string of a given integer.\
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
