# 822. Kth-Pair-Distance
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-th-smallest-pair-distance/

The distance of a pair of integers a and b is defined as the absolute difference between a and b.\
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth smallest distance among all the pairs nums[i] and nums[j] where 0 <= i < j < nums.length.\

**Example 1:**
Input: nums = [1,3,1], k = 1\
Output: 0\
Explanation: Here are all the pairs:\
(1,3) -> 2\
(1,1) -> 0\
(3,1) -> 2\
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.\

**Example 2:**
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2\
Output: 0\

**Example 3:**
Input: nums = [1,6,1], k = 3\
Output: 5\
 
**Constraints:**
n == nums.length\
2 <= n <= 104\
0 <= nums[i] <= 106\
1 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2\

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        
        def enough(n):
            i = 0
            count = 0
            for j in range(1, len(nums)):
                while nums[j] - nums[i] > n:
                    i += 1
                
                count += j-i         
            return count >= k
            
        
        l, r = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]
        
        while l <= r:
            m = l + (r-l)//2
            
            if enough(m):
                r = m-1
            else:
                l = m+1
        return l
            
```
## Analysis
When it asks for kth something, usually binary search an be an approach. Search through the possivble solution domain, and check if it meets the requirement each time. So this question can be converted to " Among all the gaps of the pairs in array "nums", which one is the first one that there are more than or equal to k gaps of other pairs are less than this gap. After rephrasing, it is very clearly a binary search problem. We firstly set l pointer to 0 and r pointer as max(nums)-min(nums), then do binary search between the two. Each time check how many smaller pairs there are. Another tricky point of this question is that to count the pairs whose gaps are smaller. Here we firstly sort the array and use two pointer\sliding window to solve this problem.(可以使用双指针一次遍历解决。具体地，首先对数组排序，然后使用右指针 j 和 左指针 i。如果 nums[j] - nums[i] 大于 diff，我们收缩 i 直到 nums[j] - nums[i] <= diff。这个时候，我们就可计算出以索引 j 结尾的绝对值差小于等于 diff 的个数，个数就是 j - i。我们可以使用滑动窗口技巧分别计算所有的 j 的个数，并将其累加起来就是答案。

**Time Complexity**: Array sorting is O(NlogN). Outer loop for binary search is O(logN). Inner loop for counting is O(N). Overall is O(NlogN).
**Space Complexity**: Depend on how much the array sorting algorithm use.
